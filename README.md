## What is our project?

  Our project is about CO2 and how population and Human Development Index (HDI) 
relate to it over the years 1990 and 2019. CO2 production has been a big problem 
in our world for many years as CO2 emissions are directly related to global 
warming. Humans are the main source for the CO2 emissions in the world, from 
mostly fossil fuels deforestation and cement production. The more CO2 we produce,
the more severe global warming will get.

  In our data, by using various different graphs, we compare CO2, population, and
HDI. First, we compare CO2 with population in 2019 to see the correlation between
them if there is one. We found that there is not a definite trend between
population and the amount of CO2 produced or one that we would expect. Then we
compare the CO2 production in the highest populated country from each continent
(Australia, Russian Federation, Nigeria, Brazil, China, and the United States)
between 1990 and 2019 to see the trend of CO2 production. Comparing the 
production in these countries the graph shows that there is an overall increase 
in CO2 production in the past 30 years. Next, we compare population with HDI and 
we are able to conclude that there is a slight decrease between the two factors.
Finally we compare HDI with CO2 in 2019 and there is a logarithmic growth curve
which increases and then decreases after a certain point. This makes sense since
humans are the main source of CO2 emissions but just because after a certain point,
the effects from CO2 emissions will negatively impact the environment and decrease
the development.

## Who is the audience?

  The audience to researchers or anyone who is interested in CO2 production and the
causes of it. We know that the production of CO2 is increasing over the years and
that humans are the main contributors to the amount of CO2 being released into the
atmosphere but using our graphs, researchers can conclude the different reasons
that factor into the production of CO2. Using this data can help researchers figure
out different strategies to help lower the amount of CO2 being produced and find
solutions to global warming in the long run.
