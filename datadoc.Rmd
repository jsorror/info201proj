# Data Documentation

## Original Data Sources:

We used two datasets to create our final merged one. These datasets are titled, “World
Population by Countries” and “Global Socio-Economic and Environmental Indicators”. Our
datasets originated from the platform “Kaggle”. The world population dataset is owned by the
user, “ASHWIN.S” and was sourced from the website data.worldbank.org. The data was also
cleaned using Pandas. The global socio-economic and environmental indicators dataset is owned
by the user, “toriqul” and sourced from the Human Development Reports website, hdr.undp.org,
and was collected with web scripting. The CO2 Emissions dataset is owned by the
user, Urik Thyge Pedersen, and was sourced from the website
https://data.nasdaq.com/databases/WB/data as well as the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the International Energy
Agency (IEA)

## Variables

The variables we included in our final merged dataset are “Country”, which is
the country’s name, “Year”, with years spanning from 1990 to 2021, “CO2
Production”, depicting the total carbon emissions in a country in a certain
year, “Population”, which states the total country population in a given year,
“HDI”, which depicts the HDI for a country in a given year, “CO2Index”, which is
a categorical variable that gives a certain index of a country’s CO2 level
depending on where it falls in our caliber (3,569,073 kt and below = “Low”,
3,569,074 kt to 7,138,146 = “Middle”, and 7,138,147 kt and above = “High”),
“AvgCO2”, which is a numerical variable that gives the calculated average CO2
production for a certain country across all years, and finally, “AvgPop”, which
is a numerical variable that gives the calculated average population for a
certain country across all years.

## Summary Statistics

We have 4,980 observations in our dataset, and 8 columns. We excluded some outlier data from
our merged dataset which had some regions listed under the "Countries" variable. These
regions include the data for individual countries combined together, which would have altered
the overall trend we were trying to extract across all countries. We excluded the regions
named "World", "South Asia", and "Sub-Saharan Africa". There are a few missing values in
the key variables for our dataset. The “Population” variable has 11 missing
values, and the “HDI” variable has 519 missing values.
